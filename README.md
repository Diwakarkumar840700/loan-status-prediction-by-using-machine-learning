# machine-learning-project1

Overview
This project aims to predict the loan status (approved or not approved) based on a set of applicant features using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of historical loan applications and is used to predict the outcome of new loan applications.

Introduction
Loan status prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to assess the risk of lending money to applicants. This project uses an SVM model to classify whether a loan application will be approved or not based on the applicant's information such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features of loan applicants such as:

Applicant Income
Coapplicant Income
Loan Amount
Loan Amount Term
Credit History
Property Area
Marital Status
Education Level
Self-Employed Status
Gender
Dataset Source
The dataset can be obtained from [source link or description].

Data Structure
Training set: Used to train the model.
Test set: Used to evaluate the model's performance.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical step in improving the performance of the SVM model. In this project, the following steps are performed:

Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing data using mean, median, or mode.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Standardizing numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
Model Architecture
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used in this project due to its ability to perform well in high-dimensional spaces and its effectiveness in classification tasks. The SVM model is built using the following parameters:

Kernel: Linear, RBF, or Polynomial (default: RBF)
C (Regularization parameter): Controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error (default: 1.0)
Gamma: Kernel coefficient for RBF and Polynomial (default: 'scale')
Training
The model is trained using the following process:

Split the dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20).
Train the model: Train the SVM model using the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform grid search or cross-validation to find the optimal parameters for the SVM model.
Training Command
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --dataset path_to_dataset --kernel rbf --c 1.0 --gamma scale
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive cases.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the performance of the classification model.
